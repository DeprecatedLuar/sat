<!-- WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:
- This file contains ONLY active phases for implementation
- Each phase = one focused session, follow top-to-bottom order determined by manual commit and push by the user, so phases should be meaningful and self-contained
- Focus on actionable steps: "Update file X, add function Y"
- Avoid verbose explanations - just implement what's specified and valuable
- Success criteria must be testable
- Make sure to test implementation after conclusion of phase
- Stop implementation and call out ideas if you find better approaches during implementation
CRITICAL: When a phase is completed:
1. DELETE it entirely from this file (do not leave it here)
2. Move a concise summary to implementation-history.md
3. Do not use emojis in this file
